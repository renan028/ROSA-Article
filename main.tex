ROSA is a research project which endeavors to design and implement a robot for
the monitoring and inspection of the process of inserting and removing stoplogs
in a power plant. The proposed system is mounted on the lifting beam,
which carries the stoplogs, and it is composed of different sensors:
inclination, pressure, and inductive sensors for monitoring; and a profiling
sonar with pan \& tilt system for inspection. This paper presents a general
overview of the robot, and a description of the developed embedded electronics, power supply system,
and software architecture. The field experiments at UHE Jirau, in Rondônia,
Brazil, using a tablet for user interface validate the concepts considered so far.
