\section{Introduction}
The Oil \& Gas demand will grow rapidly in the next decades (\cite{wna}) and the
need to obtain the resources from remote and hostile environments will increase
operation costs. Also, the working conditions on offshore installations,
characterized by unfriendly atmosphere, harsh weather conditions,
extreme temperatures, constrained space, and the logistical issues are serious obstacles for Oil \& Gas companies. In order to be competitive, companies are looking into new and better technologies to be able to produce marginal fields and gain new resources. The use of robotics in inspection, maintenance, and repair operations in Oil \& Gas facilities could greatly improve efficiency, health and safety, while decreasing operational and logistics costs.

In the specific case of Brazil, the Oil \& Gas industry is growing at a high
pace. The recent discoveries of big oil fields in the pre-salt layer off the
Brazilian coast, located 300 km from the shore at depths of 5000 to 7000 km (\cite{presal}),
motivates the development of an offshore  production system with a high degree
of automation based on advanced robotics systems.

% It is highly expensive to have people working on the rig, as they
% must be housed and protected, there are costs with personal benefits such as
% health care, and the companies need to evacuate personnel quickly
% in case of an emergency.

Recent studies forecast a substantial decrease in the level of human operation
and an increase in automation on future oil fields (\cite{skourup2009robotized}).
The studies also point out the potential increase
in efficiency and productivity with robot operators, besides of the improvement in
Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) conditions, as robots can replace humans
in tasks performed in unhealthy, hazardous, and confined areas (\cite{pal}).

\cite{chen} lists the challenges of robotics and automation in Oil
\& Gas industry:%and lists the most important requirements for robotic systems:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item The \emph{atmospheric conditions} on offshore platforms are quite unfriendly, as
hydrocarbon resources can generate explosive and toxic gases;\\ %The robot should be certified to operate in explosive environments.
\item \emph{Corrosive agents}: splashy salty water, salty air and corrosive chemicals;\\
\item \emph{Weather}: high speed wind, squalls, rain and hail. The relative humidity is up to
100\% and ambient temperature can vary between $-30^{\circ}$C to $50^{\circ}$C. Possibly highly radiant heat from equipment and direct sunlight;\\
\item \emph{Constrained space} and/or walkways. Complex structures such as pipes,
flanges, tanks, and stairways.
\end{enumerate}

%There are different kinds of robots in the oil \& gas industry such as
%underwater pipeline repair robotic systems, robots for inspection of valve and
%lever position, gas level or leakage and acoustic anomalies monitoring, and
%robots for identify and locate fire.

Currently, the majority of the robotic systems in the Oil \& Gas industry are
used for subsea tasks, such as mapping of the seabed, and inspection operation
and repair of underwater equipment, risers and pipelines. However, recent research has focused on robotic applications on the topside of platforms to perform inspection and maintenance tasks, which includes valve and lever manipulation, gas level and leakage monitoring, acoustic anomalies diagnosis, and identification of smoke and fire.

The MIMROex inspection robot (\cite{mimroex}) was developed and
tested by the Fraunhofer Institute of Manufacturing Engineering and Automation
(IPA). The robot is capable of safely navigate in offshore environments, and
autonomously execute inspection tasks. Sensabot (\cite{sensabot}), a
teleoperated inspection robot developed by Carnegie Mellon University, was
designed for severe weather and atmosphere, being certified to operate in toxic, flammable and explosive environments. The SINTEF Topside Robotic System, developed in the robotic lab facility in
Trondheim, Norway, is an intelligent instrumentation system designed to enable onshore operators
to monitor and control the platform's processes (\cite{kyrkjebo2009robotic}).


%The robot includes the following sensors:
%\begin{enumerate}[i)]
%    \item Hydrocarbon sensor
%    \item Pan/tilt/zoom camera for remote operations
%    \item Temperature sensors
%    \item Vibration sensor for pumps, motors and bearings inspection
%    \item Microphone to detect audible machinery problems
%    \item Video camera to detect obstacles
%\end{enumerate}


%In this paper, we describe the DORIS project, which aims to develop a mobile
%robot to perform monitoring and inspection in an
%offshore platform. To this end, the system must be able to move throughout the
%monitored environment carrying different sensors, analyzing sensor data
%\emph{in loco} or storing it for a posterior analysis, and interpreting the
%results. The sensors can identify abnormalities such as intruders in restricted
%areas, abandoned objects, smoke, fire, and liquid and gas leakages.
%Furthermore, the robot is able to make machinery diagnosis, read instruments,
%and takes samples using an embedded manipulator (\cite{cba}).

In this paper, we present a general overview of the DORIS robot, and a detailed description of the embedded electronics, power supply system and software architecture. The robot is designed to perform monitoring and inspection tasks in an
offshore platform, being able to move throughout the monitored environment carrying different sensors, analyzing sensor data \emph{in loco} or storing it for a posterior analysis, and interpreting the results.
